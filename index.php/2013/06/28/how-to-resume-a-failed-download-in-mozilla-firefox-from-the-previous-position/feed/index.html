Danny, the workaround I mentioned in this post was regarding the in-built download manager of Firefox browser. I haven&#039;t used &quot;Flash Video Downloader&quot; addon, so I won&#039;t be able to comment on that. But my guess is that it might be saving the bits for the incomplete downloads with a different file extension or even at a different temporary folder.

And about an alternative download manager, I would recommend an integrated download manager like &quot;Internet Download Manager&quot; over browser addons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use McDonalds free Wifi with XP Pro and Firefox version 19.

However, when I download files I don&#039;t see any &quot;.part&quot; files on my computer like I use to on my home computer with a internet modem connection.
I have done a search of my hard drive for &quot;part&quot; files of known interrupted downloads but there are none.
I use the Firefox AddOn &quot;Flash Video Downloader&quot;.

Does this downloader do something internally to remove the &quot;.part&quot; file?  If so, can you recommend another Firefox Addon and does it store the downloaded file with a different extension? 
 
I use Firefox 19 because of the problem logging into websites with certificate problems and took the advice of another person and I have no problems now.

Please reply.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU! So much! My connection broke after downloading 3,25GB of a very important 3,5GB work-related video, if I had had to do it again from the beginning I would have been so screwed. But I have learned my lesson, from now on I&#039;ll use an external DL manager that can do this trick on its own :). 
Thanks again!]]></description>
