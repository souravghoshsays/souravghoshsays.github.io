Contrastingly, the final fight scenes included <em>crucial<\/em> reminders like &#8220;it&#8217;s not a work day&#8221; or a traumatised island is &#8220;inhabited&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>One thing is certain, Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Dark Knight would definitely not fit into this universe, in spite of deserving a high place in its own regard. Ben Affleck seemed quite\u00a0into his gritty character for this dark DC universe.\u00a0Still wish there was more reason why the retired crusader would be convinced of the need for eliminating Superman.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting how Martha Kent keeps getting involved in his son&#8217;s affairs. I can&#8217;t say more without giving away spoilers.<\/p>\n<p>I partially regret watching the film in 3D though, the fight sequences portrayed in the dark scenes gave me a bit of a headache, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.<\/p>\n<p>On the bright side, the battle entrance of Wonder Woman was nothing short of what I expected of a superhero&#8217;s dramatic intro since childhood; <em>it still gives me a sort of adrenaline rush<\/em>. The accompanying background score was well-conceived fit for the Amazonian warrior princess.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>If you grew up with the image of a Superman who flies by and saves the day and everyone is smiling and happy, then this movie might disappoint you. Although I somehow feel that this is probably a much realistic portrayal to how things would play out in the real world anyway, because let&#8217;s face it, a perfect black or white character is a myth, and given the circumstances, if you are <i>doing<\/i>\u00a0something, you will have some who tries to oppose you! And yes, in a battle of super beings, there would always be unfortunate but inevitable collateral damage.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, it&#8217;s best to go to the movies and decide for yourself.
