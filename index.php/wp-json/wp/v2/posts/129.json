It is quite normal for third-party security companies to not support beta operating systems, as the code is not final, and is subject to change. A security suite is dependent on various internal parts of the OS, and so it will take Windows 8.1 to be released to manufacturing before they are officially supported by security giants like Kaspersky and ESET. So, like it or not, for the time being, security freaks will have to do with Windows Defender and Windows Firewall.<\/p>\n<p>That might be okay for quite many people who want to test a beta OS in the first place. But if you are concerned about security and have set your network type to private, then <!--more-->you might find a hard time changing it in Windows 8.1 to public. It is because the older methods of selecting network type from Network and Sharing Center as in Windows 7, or the by using the Settings extension that slid in from the right, revealing available networks as in Windows 8, won\u2019t work here.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, for now, <b>this setting is hidden away in the new PC Settings Modern UI app<\/b> that brings almost the entire Desktop Control Panel to the characteristic UI of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Just head on to PC Settings (type into the Start screen)&gt;Network, and click on the relevant network. You will find an option called \u201cFind devices and content\u201d. If you are on a private network like your home network, it is safe to leave it on. But it is recommended that you set it off if you are on a public network. Changing this option will automatically reflect on the familiar Network and Sharing Center.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"mashsb-container mashsb-main mashsb-stretched\"><div class=\"mashsb-box\"><div class=\"mashsb-count mash-large\" style=\"float:left;\"><div class=\"counts mashsbcount\">82<\/div><span class=\"mashsb-sharetext\">SHARES<\/span><\/div><div class=\"mashsb-buttons\"><a class=\"mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fwordpress%2Findex.php%2F2013%2F07%2F03%2Fswitching-network-type-in-windows-8-1%2F\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\"><\/span><span class=\"text\">&nbsp;Tell&nbsp;your&nbsp;friends&nbsp;<\/span><\/a><a class=\"mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=&url=http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/2013\/07\/03\/switching-network-type-in-windows-8-1\/&via=Sourav_Ghosh\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span class=\"icon\"><\/span><span class=\"text\">&nbsp;Tweet&nbsp;about&nbsp;this&nbsp;<\/span><\/a><div class=\"onoffswitch2 mash-large mashsb-noshadow\" style=\"display:none;\"><\/div><\/div>\n            <\/div>\n                <div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><div class=\"mashsb-toggle-container\"><\/div><\/aside>\n            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.7-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Windows 8.1 Preview has just been released to the public, and in case you have installed this preview build on your machine, chances are you might have observed that some software (especially security suites) that were working perfectly in your Windows 8 machine won\u2019t work here.
