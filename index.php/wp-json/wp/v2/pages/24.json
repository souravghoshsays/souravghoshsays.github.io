As an active member, I organised sessions for students on technologies which are not covered in university curriculum but are nonetheless quite important in today\u2019s market.<\/p>\n<p>I like to learn by exploring and take an active interest in modifying configurations of different software in order to get a better understanding of their working procedure. I enjoy going through tech blogs, and sharing knowledge via social media &amp; my personal blog.<\/p>\n<p>One of my early publications was on \u201cA Social Networking Model for Learning through Web Net\u201d published in AICTE sponsored National Conference.
