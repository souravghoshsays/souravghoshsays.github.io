Ltd. in the month of June 2013. Our project was appreciated as one of the best projects and an industry-ready one, which really means a lot for us!\r\n\r\nMuzikSpot is an online music store from where the music of many popular genres can be downloaded without having to pay for them, i.e. it is a free download site. It has six genres-Bollywood, Pop, Rock\/Metal, Blues, and Jazz & Electronica.\r\n\r\nA customer can download songs only if he\/she is a registered user. Any user who is not registered can only explore the store search for, and play the songs but may not download.\r\n\r\nRegistered artists can upload their albums and songs. They can check the number of downloads of their songs and also the number of uploaded songs. A special feature has been implemented in this project called MEI (Music Experience Index).\r\n\r\nMEI shows the ratio of the total number of downloads to the total number of uploads rated on a scale
